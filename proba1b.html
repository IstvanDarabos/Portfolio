<!-- The development of the web page shows a learning process.
   / I'm a student.:) /
   Therefore it is not completely unified. At the end of the development
   I got to the grid system, which is the most modern system.
   This should be continued. And rewrite the web page based on the grid system.
   This is a very nice and interesting direction. I think it.
   There are many symbolic references on the page. Poem. :) Therefore
    - and because of the symmetry - first I put "only" three images.
     (For example, Hawking's negative opinion from philosophy, here we are
      also referring to the need for philosophy, if we want to solve
       the problems of today and tomorrow, or the Higgs photo: deliberately
        "mixed" with art. We will not be able to stand on one leg. (My opinion:
        Not even now.) We must be a unit of science and art and.... Etc., etc. -->

            <p>Knowledge helps to make ourselves better, helps to make the world better.
               But unfortunately, we don't know so much YET that, they wouldn't be able to
               make use of the knowledge for evil purposes. We can say "only" so much yet
               now, everybody's own individual responsibility, and his enormous individual
               responsibility, how decides how: chooses the light or the darkness.
               Today yet - unfortunately - it is possible to make a choice. Although we
               know that it is real knowledge, the light, and the evil, the darkness
               are in an antagonistic contrast with each other. There is "no" trouble
               with this. The trouble is that, we can be in such circumstances, that
               it demands almost superhuman effort for us that we remain men,
               true men, the light, knowledge, the simple soldiers of the affection.
               That's why everyone has a huge responsibility in that, how to
               decide, what to choose. Without exception, everyone's decision
               matters a lot. Not "just" for her own fate, but for the fate of
               all of us too.

            and the <footer> tags can be freely moved and replicated within the
